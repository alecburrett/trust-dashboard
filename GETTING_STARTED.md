In a new terminal, run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/init \
  -H "Content-Type: "application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!",
    "name": "Admin User"
  }'
```

### 3. Log In to Admin Dashboard

2. Update:
   - Company name

   - Primary color
   - Logo URL (optional)
   - Header image URL (optional)

## What's Included Out of the Box

- Default branding configuration

### Pages Available

**Public Pages:**

## Next Steps

### Add Your Own Certifications

2. Click "Certifications"
3. Add your actual certifications with real data

### Customize Content

1. Edit security controls to match your actual systems

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

Follow the prompts to deploy your dashboard!

### Upgrade to Production Database

For production use, migrate to Vercel Postgres:

1. Create a Postgres database in Vercel dashboard
2. Copy connection strings to `.env`
3. Follow migration guide in `lib/db/README.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use

```bash
# Use a different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### Admin Login Not Working

1. Make sure you created an admin user via the `/api/admin/init` endpoint
2. Check that `.env` file exists with `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
3. Clear browser cookies and try again

### Build Errors

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Monday Morning Checklist

### Start Here on Monday:

**Immediate Tasks (Do First):**

1. **Verify Vercel Deployment**
   - [ ] Check if Vercel build succeeded
   - [ ] Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set in Vercel
   - [ ] Test login at `/admin/login`
   - [ ] Create admin user via API

2. **Build Certifications Management** (Priority #1)
   - Start with: `app/admin/certifications/page.tsx`
   - Build the list view first
   - Then add create/edit forms
   - Goal: Be able to add certifications through admin UI

3. **Build Security Controls Management** (Priority #2)
   - Similar to certifications
   - Focus on CRUD operations

4. **Add File Upload** (Priority #3)
   - Set up Vercel Blob
   - Implement upload for logos/images
   - Test with certification badges

**Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test build
npm run build

# Create admin user (after starting server)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@test.com","password":"test123","name":"Admin"}'

# Check if Vercel deployment is live
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

## üìä Project Completion Estimate

**Current Progress:** ~60% complete

**Time Estimates:**
- High Priority Tasks: 12-16 hours
- Medium Priority Tasks: 8-10 hours
- Low Priority Tasks: 15-20 hours
- **Total Remaining:** 35-46 hours (~1 week of full-time work)

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Complete all High Priority tasks first (admin management pages)
2. Test thoroughly with real data
3. Deploy to production
4. Add Medium Priority features iteratively
5. Low Priority can be added post-launch

---

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **In-memory database** - Data resets on server restart (expected, will fix with Postgres)
2. **No admin pages** - Can't manage content yet (top priority)
3. **No file uploads** - Need Vercel Blob integration
4. **AI chatbot** - Very basic, needs better responses
5. **No email notifications** - Access requests have no notifications

---

## üìû Questions to Address

- [ ] Do we need multi-tenant support (multiple companies)?
- [ ] What file size limits for uploads?
- [ ] What certification types should be supported?
- [ ] Do we need approval workflows beyond simple approve/deny?
- [ ] Should certifications have expiry date reminders?
- [ ] Do we need user roles (super admin, editor, viewer)?

---
